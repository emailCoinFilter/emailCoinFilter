Announcing emailCoinFilter, a new system using cryptocurrency to help filter spam from your inbox. Differentiating between junk email and desired email has always been a challenge. With emailCoinFilter you can set an coin amount for people to reach your inbox. And similarly if you want to ensure your email gets to others inbox you can attach a transaction of cryptocurrency. You can also add emails to a white list which will not require their email to have cryptocurrency and you can add to a black list which will always send the email to the bulk mail folder. If you find after a while that you are still getting too many emails to your inbox, you can always raise the amount of coin required. With this, you are the recipient of the postage in the email. Over time you may collect enough postage to pay for your time you spent reading messages in your inbox.
